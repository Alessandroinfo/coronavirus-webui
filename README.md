When you open the application, you will see the latest statistics on the coronavirus epidemic in Italy and around the world. The data is displayed on a single page, with the global and Italy totals at the top and the detailed table of regions at the bottom.

The global and Italy totals display the following statistics:

Click on a row in the region table to view detailed statistics for that region. The region table displays the following statistics for each region:

The data is retrieved from the Firebase database and updated every few minutes to ensure that the statistics are accurate.
